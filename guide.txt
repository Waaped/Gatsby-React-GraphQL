#1 Gatsby Project install

1. npm install -g Gatsby-cli@x.x.x
2. Gatsby new ‘Enter project Name’ https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
3. In package.json you can see the scripts available, we will start with ‘start’, npm run develop.
4. Local host 8000 manual start
5. 14:51 Next lesson

#2 Working with Gatsby Pages

1. Create pages, pages are automatically pathed in Gatsby localhost:8000/blog
    1. SRC>PAGES>BLOG.JS,INDEX.JS
2. Challenge consisted of creating pages in the same directory of index.js

#3 Linking between pages using Gatsby
1.       <p>need a developer? <a href="/contact">Contact me</a></p>
2. This is one way, Gatsby has other ways of optimizing this/faster/static
    1. import {Link } from 'gatsby'
    2. …
    3. <p>Need a developer? <Link to='/contact'>Contact me.</Link></p>
3. Link Gatsby component is the correct way of doing this, but <A> anchor tag is still valid for external website links
4. While the anchor tag  loads/reloads the page every time you click, Gatsby Preloads the page making it just as fast (Real time almost) as the click.
5. Challenge, external link to website/twitter/whatever, and about page links to contact page using Gatsby Link
    1. target=‘_blank’ for new browser tab when opening link, mine didn’t do that initially.
#4 Creating Shared Components
1. Creating a new footer and header component. option+G creates copyright in Mac, Just Normal React
2. As simple as it seems, we are beginning to USE dry methods that make it easy to update information across pages/components
3. Though I feel we Repeated ourselves too many times..

#5 Creating  Gatsby Page Layouts
1. Time for reusable page layouts I think! He calls it Universal Layout Component
2. We wrap the index.js unique information(Title, description) and remove non unique imported (Headers/footer component)
3. Then we add props as a parameter, and props.children to display the elements wrapped inside the layout component.


import React from 'react';

const Layout =(props)=>{
    return(
        <div>
            {props.children}
        </div>
    )
}

//without props.chidlren the it would just display an empty div

export default Layout

4. Now we can import Header and footer into the Layout Div to DRY things up!

const Layout =(props)=>{
    return(
        <div>
            <Header/>
            {props.children} //child component text/divs
            <Footer/>
            
        </div>

…Index.js.js

Import Layout

const IndexPage = () => {
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Head title="Home" />. ///
            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <h2>I'm Rafael, a full-stack developer living in beautiful Long Beach.</h2>
            
        </Layout>
    )
} 

5.  Doing this for the next components(about.js,blog.js)

#6 Styling for Gatsby Projects 1:00 hour mark

1. Adding CSS file, and importing it to Layout.css
2. Going through Gatsby packages in the gastbyjs.org, we will be installing sass
3. npm install gatsby-plugin-sass node-sass
4. Changed index.css into index.scss, Updated import on layout.js, used SCSS variable.

$color:green;

*{
    color:$color;
}

5. Links this page https://links.mead.io/gatsbystyles
    1. Copies entire css via RAW, and pastes into index.scss

#7 Stying Gatsby with css modules
1. CSS modules allow you to build complex styling, without the complexity.
2. We build a header.scss in the components folder, just for the header
3. Once we import the style into header, it is affecting the entire page, because the a tags are not scoped to the component
    1. We change the header.scss into modular scss. So the styling becomes dynamic. Header.module.scsss
    2. This stops the global CSS problems you had in Your Vendo App when you implemented the State managed component ‘CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.’
        1. Inside header.js
					<ul><li><Link className={headerStyles.link} to='/'>Home</Link></li>
            1. He described it as dynamic
		2. Inside header.module.scss just a normal .link class 
		3. Creates another modular scss layout.module.scss
		4. Moving some divs around to deal with the footer, layout.syles.content, he did some advance css for the 			sticky footer
		5. More styling when you add a class name like .nav-list to react, you must include it like .headerStyles.navList 		in react camel case and it will render correctly.
		6.from 1:20 he starts styling navs,
			1. Most interesting jsx attribute he used was activeClassName, makes things easier for nav bar highlight

#8 Gatsby Data with GraphQL 1:28:25

1. Going into Gatsby-config.js          
2. 
3. module.exports = {
  /* Your site config here */
  siteMetadata:{
    title:'FullStack-Raf',
    author:'Rafael Vasquez'
  },
  plugins:[
    'gatsby-plugin-sass'
  ]
}

2. We can see what graphQL schema looks looks like at (GraphiQL) http://localhost:8000/___graphql
3. Importing graphQL, userStaticQuery from Gatsby
4. Restart the app and NPM run Build
5. In Header JS input a const inside the header like this, and call your data in the link h1 like this{}

import { Link, graphql,useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby';
import headerStyles from './header.module.scss'

const Header =() => {
    const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title / /We must specify the what piece of data/information we want in siteMetadata, in this case Title
        }
      }
    }
  `)
    return (
        <header className={headerStyles.header}>
            <h1>
                <Link className={headerStyles.title} to='/'>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</Link>
1. By Importing graphQL and useStaticQuery we can keep data consistent across the app, and update information without repeating ourselves. Then we injected into the JSX.
2. Challenge: Put dynamic data into footer for author using the same techinque from the header component

#9 GraphQL Playground

May 30! Update, Don't use this causes more headaches, as the graphQL schema gets updated, Content didn't update from contentful after 30 minutes, nothing was wrong with my server, or api keys. But the normal graphql IDE was updated 
without a hitch. Might run well on your build, not mine.

1. Instead of using GraphiQL to test queries we will be installing GraphQL playground a newer solution
2. 1:47 mark, Just new IDE.
    1. npm install --save-dev env-cmd
    2. Create .env.development file in next to package.json in source
        1. Insert text GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground into .env.dev
        2. In the package.json Change the develop line under scripts, 
        3. The Minus f was learned from a yt comment, should have googled myself the installation of the package
        4.  "develop": "env-cmd -f .env.development gatsby develop"
    3. The New GraphQl IDE UI is much better, and you can now have multiple tabs.


#10 Sourcing Content from the file system

1.Putting Data in our react components was great to demonstrate how GraphQL works, but for more complex/larger bits of information this will get a little clunky/bad

W-PED: gatsby-bootcamp raf$ npm install gatsby-source-filesystem@2.0.28

He creates a Posts file in the directory, and two md files
 	1. Gatsby.md and react.MD styled like a github readme
	2.  Edits, Gatsby-Config file, installs another Gatsby plugin Gatsby-transformer-remark 
	3. Npm run develop, we will now be able to access our parsed md files in the graphQL API
	4. Running a query 
		query {
  			allMarkdownRemark {
				    edges {
 				     node {
   					     frontmatter {
   								       title
  								        date
  							      }
							        html
					        excerpt
						      }
						    }
					  }
				}
	5.  Had to shift the title:(shift here)’’, and date:	‘’ for key value paring in MarkdownRemark to work

#11 Generating Markdown Posts
	1. Inserting the data Const, into our blog, creating a .map to iterate over our edge>node>frontmatter
		2:03:20
	
#12 Generating Slugs
	Dynamically creating pages from .md blog posts
	
	Goals
	1. Generate a slug for each post
	2. Generate the blog post page template
	3. Generate a new page for each post
	
1.  Generating Gatsby-node.js file at source
2.  Gatsbys.org/docs/apir-reference---> Gatsby Node APIs, APIs we can use with the Gatsby-node.js file.
3. Headed to Node.js documentation/ path.basename(path,=[, ext]) returns the last portion of a path …/articles/5-5-2019/sushi-Tour-Day-5’ would extract sushi-tour-day-5, allowing you to sluggify and create a path in your routes!
4. Refer to node js documentation for some of the coding he did in the node js file

#13 Dynamically Generating Pages

1. Created new Directory in src. Called ’Templates’
    1. In templates we create a blog.js file, with basic React, and Layout import in the function(const) 
    2. We head to Gatsby.js Documentation and look at the documentation called createPage.
	3. Using node to retrieve markdown in template/blog.js
#13 Creating images
	1. npm install gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.0.32 gatsby-remark-images@3.0.10 gatsby-remark-relative-images
	2. Feels a little pointless, as we will be using a CMS
#14 Contentful.com
	1.Create your data model in regular text, fields(Time,Slug,Date/time,Body) 
	2. In order to source contentful, we will need to go to Gatsbyjs.org and pick up the gatsby-source-contentful 		package. We can use the Wordpress version, but here we will stick with source contentful as we have already 		created the model.
	3. Add the plugin to Gatsby config, the usual Plugin,Resolve,Option, Get the API keys from contentful.
		1.Space ID, and Content Delivery API access token needed.
	 plugins: [ {
    resolve:'gatsby-source-contentful',
    options:{
      spaceId:process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID,
      accessToken:process.env.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    }
  },
 
4. In ENV.development add these lines and insert your API tokens into it,
    1. CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID={Your key, no brackets}
    2. CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN={Your key, no brackets}

#15 Rendering Content in Blog Post
	1. Heading into Gatsby-node.js, removing and replacing allmarkDownQuery.
	2. Had to redo Data model, body to rich text from regular text, all kinds of npm issues for a simple change
	3.Could’nt connect fields, node type and blog, for contentful images and blogs, so many npm errors 
	4. Decided to npm install cloned project from his directory, nothing was wrong on my end,some updated
	graphQL syntax in npm package from a a month ago interfered, Decided not to go down the rabbit hole any longer.	will drill down myself later.
	5. Installing React helmet for Gatsby ‘Gatsby-plugin-react-helmet’

#16 Deployment
1. Creating private Github Repository, git remote add from existing repository.
2. Deployment Netlify, Github auto deploys any time you push to master, great to test features out.
3. Add variables, the two from step #14 section 4.
4. Manual deploy for the first time only.
5. Contentful content no auto-deployed, Do it yourself

Bootcamp over, lets build!
